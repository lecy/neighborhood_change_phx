# PEDA Capstone: Neighborhood Change Phoenix

This project is an analysis of Phoenix demographic data changes from 1990-2015 indicating potential neighborhood change. It was done as the Capstone Project for students in the Master of Program Evaluation and Data Analytics Program through the Watts College of Public Service and Community Solutions at ASU.

The overall goal of this project is to highlight Phoenix demographic data changes from 1990-2015. Another goal of this project is to layout all the steps of this project so that others are able to replicate the project and produce the same results. 

Data sources for this project include:
The Census API for 2015 data and select 2010 data, and the NHGIS time series data tables for 1990, 2000, and select 2010 data retrieved from https://www.nhgis.org/.
